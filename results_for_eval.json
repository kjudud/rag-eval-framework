It is considered an ideal carbon- free fuel for low- carbon energy technologies.[1] The Haber- Bosch process, conventionally used for synthesizing  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ , involves high pressure and temperature, leading to excessive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.[2] In recent years, there has been extensive interest in using water as a hydrogen source for the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ , which allows the direct generation of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  from  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  under mild environmental conditions.[3] The outlook for the NRR appears grim due to the high energy required to cleave the non- polar  $\\mathrm{N} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$  bond  $(941\\mathrm{kJ}\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1})$  and low solubility of  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  in most electrolytes, which promotes the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and results in poor  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  selectivity and subpar current efficiency.[4] These problems severely limit the activity and selectivity of the NRR in aqueous media, which is a major constraint.  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  electrosynthesis can prospectively be realized via the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ , because of the substantially lower cleavage energy of the  $\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{O}$  bond  $(204\\mathrm{kJ}\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1})$  compared to that of the  $\\mathrm{N} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$  bond. In contrast with non- polar  $\\mathrm{N}_2$ ,  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  has excellent solubility in water, making it an appealing nitrogen supply that can potentially accelerate the kinetics of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3 / \\mathrm{NH}_4^+$  formation.[5] Additionally,  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  undergoes greater electrocatalytic reduction in the same thermodynamic potential range as  $\\mathrm{N}_2$ .[6]\n\nSingle- atom catalysts (SACs) have unique atomic structures and electronic properties that make them superior to bulk catalysts and nano catalysts. Researchers in the field of catalysis have shown great interest in SACs because of their remarkable activity and selectivity in many catalytic reactions.[7] The development of numerous  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  electrocatalysts is now a priority. Homogeneous and heterogeneous SACs offer new prospects for electrocatalysis and represent a potential  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  catalyst category. A significant number of pyrolytic SACs with an M- N- C (metal- nitrogen- carbon) structure have been studied for accelerating the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ .[8] Fe- N- C SACs have been extensively studied because of their low cost and excellent selectivity over a wide range of potential windows.[9] Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of Fe- N- C SACs can be fine- tuned by altering the coordination number or introducing vacancies to tune the electronic configuration of the Fe atom center.[10] Despite significant advances, the fundamentally stagnant kinetics of"

          "text": "# Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single-Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia\n\nXue- Feng Cheng, Jing- Hui He,* Hao- Qing Ji, Hao- Yu Zhang, Qiang Cao, Wu- Ji Sun, Cheng- Lin Yan, and Jian- Mei Lu*\n\nNitrate electrocatalytic reduction  $(NO_3RR)$  for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N- cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber- Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long- term stability of  $NO_3RR$  catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry- broken Cusingle- atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than  $2000h$  while an average ammonia production rate of  $27.84\\mathrm{mg h^{- 1} cm^{- 2}}$  at an industrial level current density of  $366\\mathrm{mA cm^{- 2}}$  is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long- term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis- configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more  $NO_3^-$  near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis- coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital- symmetry- matched  $\\pi$  - complex of the key intermediate \\*ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the  $\\sigma$  - complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single- atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordinationsymmetry- broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nAccumulation of nitrate  $(NO_3^- )$  in groundwater causes photochemical smog and acid rain, and the in vivo conversion of  $NO_3^-$  to nitrite  $(NO_2^- )$  further induces methemoglobinemia and cancers.[1] Thus, closing the  $NO_3^- = N$  cycle by electrochemically reducing nitrate to a valued product ammonia, is promising for reducing carbon dioxide  $(CO_2)$  release and for environmental remediation.[2] In addition, ammonia  $(NH_3)$  as one of the most common chemical feedstocks[3] is mainly produced by the Haber- Bosch method, involving the reaction of  $N_2$  and  $H_2$  at high temperatures, accompanied by  $1 - 2\\%$  energy consumption and  $CO_2$  release.[4] Therefore, the nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction  $(NO_3RR)$  to ammonia, has recently attracted intensive interest because of the high water solubility of  $NO_3^-$  and the low dissociation energy of the  $N = O$  bond  $(204\\mathrm{kJ mol^{- 1}})$  of  $NO_3^-$ .[3a] Numerous noble metal nanoparticles,[2a,3] metal oxides,[10] and 2D materials[7] have been prepared and demonstrated their promising  $NO_3RR$  performance. Even though relatively high catalytic activity was obtained,[2a,8] only a few works focused on improving the catalytic stability.[9] Long- term stability of cata lyst is a more important factor towards real applications,[10] as deactivation of initially activated electrocatalysts after long- term operation due to passivation, leaching, and corrosion often occurs in industrialization.[9,11]"

However, because of a lack of intricate control mechanisms and thorough understanding of the structure of atom- pairs, the concept remains in its infancy and requires urgent advancement.\n\nIn this study, we strategically incorporate single Cu atoms into the microscopic structure of FeNC and finely adjust the 3d electronic configuration of the Fe site to augment its activity. However, Cu is considered an inert metal, and its presence can inhibit the competitive HER. In this regard, a nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu atom pair was designed for achieving high- efficiency  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  where the more electronegative Cu species is expected to raise the d- orbital energy level of the Fe active site, thereby strongly promoting the rate of the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ .

The innovative material, is utilized in a simple  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery device for the selective electroreduction of nitrogen oxyanions and synthesis of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ .\n\n# Results and Discussion\n\nBy using a straightforward liquid- phase deposition technique, completely exposed nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu pairs were effectively created with theoretical loadings of Fe:  $1.69\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  and Cu:  $1.89\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  (Table S1). The morphology and structure of FeCu DAC was initially investigated using aberration- corrected high- angle annular dark- field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF- STEM). As highlighted by the orange ovals, the densely distributed bright dots represent the Fe- Cu atom pairs. As depicted in Figure 1a, ultrasmall Fe- Cu pairs were completely exposed and evenly dispersed on the carbon substrate, devoid of any crystallized iron or copper nanoparticles. The dispersion of several spot pairs with two distinct contrasts on the carbon matrix can be observed in the atomic- resolution HAADF- STEM images, which points to the presence of numerous Fe- Cu diatomic pairs in the matrix. The magnified HAADF- STEM images (Figure 1b) show several colored spots with distinctive contrast and brightness owing to the differing Z- axis contrasts of Fe and Cu, which were clustered together to generate atomic groups, each of which included an Fe atom and a neighboring Cu atom. Moreover, the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of FeCu DAC (Figure 1f) show the simultaneous presence of iron and copper species within cluster regions on the surface, indicating that the Fe- Cu pairs are mainly composed of completely exposed and widely dispersed Fe and Cu atoms."

The high- resolution N is XPS profile of FeCu DAC definitively proved the existence of oxidized N  $(402.6\\mathrm{eV})$ , graphitic N  $(400.9\\mathrm{eV})$ , and pyridinic N  $(398.3\\mathrm{eV})$  (Figure S12). Notably, the spectrum of the metal- containing samples indicated the presence of other N species with a peak at  $399.9\\mathrm{eV}$ , attributed to pyrrolic metal- N coordination.[13] Additional information the electronic interactions was acquired using X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Figure 2a shows the XANES spectrum at the Fe K- edge for FeCu DAC, FePc (iron phthalocyanine, with Fe- N groups), and FeO, as well as that of  $\\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and Fe foil. The absorption edge position of FeCu DAC was between those of FePc and FeO, indicating that the average valence state of Fe was approximately  $+2$ . The local configuration around Fe was investigated using the Fourier transform (FT) of the extended X- ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum at the Fe K- edge (Figure 2c). The spectrum of FeCu DAC exhibits a maximum peak at  $1.53\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , matching the Fe- N first- shell coordination. There is no signal of the metallic Fe- Fe bond at  $2.12\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for FeCu DAC, again confirming the high dispersion of the metal atom. Excitingly, a distinct scattering path was observed at  $3.65\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the spectrum of FeCu DAC, which is neither from Fe- N  $(1.53\\mathrm{\\AA})$  nor from metallic Fe- Fe  $(2.12\\mathrm{\\AA})$ . From EXAFS curve- fitting analysis, it is deduced that such a path could be reasonably attributed to the contribution of Fe- N- Cu (Figure 2e). The Cu K- edge XANES spectrum was examined to provide additional structural details. Cu is in an average valence state that is positively charged (Figure 2b), where the edge position was close to that of the  $2+$  valence state of CuPc (copper phthalocyanine, with Cu- N groups). The Cu K- edge FT- EXAFS spectrum of FeCu DAC (Figure 2d), showed a main peak at  $1.56\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , which is obviously different from the dominant peak at  $2.24\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for Cu foil originating from the Cu- Cu bond. Furthermore, a tiny peak was also observed at  $3.47\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the spectrum of FeCu DAC at the Cu K- edge, similar to that observed at the Fe K- edge, the presence of which offers compelling proof of the Fe- N- Cu bond. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis, which enables high- resolution visualisation of the R- space, was executed to further confirm the existence of the Fe- N- Cu path (Figure 2g).

These data provide insights into the electronic structure and local configuration of FeCu DAC, revealing the coordination environment and interactions of Fe and Cu atoms within the catalyst.\n\nSpecifically, the XANES spectra at the Fe and Cu edges give information about the average valence states of Fe and Cu in FeCu DAC, indicating their oxidation states and electronic properties. The EXAFS analysis further elucidates the coordination environment around Fe and Cu atoms, showing the distances between the metal atoms and their neighboring ligands. The fitted structure of the Fe and Cu sites in FeCu DAC confirms the presence of Fe-N and Fe-Cu bonds, highlighting the specific atomic arrangements within the catalyst.\n\nBy understanding the electronic interactions, valence states, and coordination geometries of Fe and Cu in FeCu DAC, researchers can infer how these structural features influence the catalytic activity for NO2- reduction to ammonia. The presence of Fe-Cu bonds and specific atomic arrangements can facilitate electron redistribution, promote catalytic conversion of intermediates, and lower energy barriers for key reaction steps, ultimately enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of FeCu DAC in converting NO2- to NH3.

      "gt_answer": "The catalyst-supported carbon cloth cathode paired with a Zn plate anode in a Zn-NO2 battery creates an efficient setup for electrochemical NO2RR, as the catalyst on carbon cloth offers a high surface area and good electron transport, while the Zn anode is inexpensive and provides a stable counter electrode; this combination enhances the overall catalytic effectiveness for ammonia production.",
      "response": "The catalyst-supported carbon cloth cathode and Zn plate anode design significantly impacts the electrochemical NO2RR and overall catalytic effectiveness in the Zn-NO2 battery configuration. In the study, a highly efficient dual-atom catalyst with Fe-Cu atomic pair sites (FeCu DAC) was used, which exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the Zn-NO2 battery. The FeCu DAC achieved a record-breaking power density of 23.6 mWcm^-1 and a maximum NH3 Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 92.23% at 20mAcm^-2. This design allowed for high energy output and efficient NH3 production, demonstrating the effectiveness of the catalyst-supported carbon cloth cathode and Zn plate anode in enhancing the electrochemical NO2RR and overall catalytic performance of the Zn-NO2 battery.",

Moreover, the ammonia- generating performance of the  $\\mathrm{FeCuN}_7$  active site is outstanding compared to that of other  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  systems that typically employ bulk or nanocluster metal catalysts. To investigate the active sites on FeCu DAC, a control experiment was performed with Fe and Cu atoms supported on a carbon substrate for comparison with FeCu DAC (Figure S19).

      "gt_answer": "The high power density and Zn utilization ratios were primarily achieved by carefully selecting the electrolyte and electrode materials, specifically using 1 M KOH at the anode and 0.1 M KOH + 0.1 M NaNO2 at the cathode, separated by a proton exchange membrane. The tailored FeCu DAC catalyst at the cathode also played a significant role, enhancing NO2^- reduction efficiency and enabling elevated current densities with minimal Zn loss, resulting in peak performance metrics.",
      "response": "The high peak power density of 23.6 mW cm^-2 and Zn utilization ratios above 90% in the Zn-NO2 battery system were achieved through several key factors in the setup:\n\n1. **FeCu DAC Catalyst:** The FeCu DAC catalyst with Fe-Cu atomic pair sites played a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency of the system. This catalyst demonstrated exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity, leading to high Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for NH3 production and improved power density.\n\n2. **Nitrite Reduction Reaction (NO2RR):** The use of the nitrite reduction reaction for generating NH3 provided a promising alternative to traditional nitrogen reduction reactions. The low N=O bond energy and high solubility of nitrite contributed to the efficiency of the system.\n\n3. **Optimized Electrolyte Composition:** The specific composition of the electrolyte, with 1M KOH for the anode and 0.1M KOH + 0.1M NaNO2 for the cathode, played a role in driving the electrocatalytic reduction of NO2 to NH3. This optimized electrolyte setup contributed to the high performance of the battery.\n\n4. **Stability and Durability:** The battery exhibited excellent stability over 6 hours and demonstrated sustained NH3 yield and FE with slight variations, indicating long-term durability. This stability factor is crucial for maintaining high performance over extended periods.\n\n5. **Current Density Optimization:** The system was optimized for different current densities, with specific capacities and utilization ratios determined at various output current densities. This optimization strategy likely contributed to achieving high Zn utilization ratios above 90%.\n\nOverall, the combination of an efficient catalyst, appropriate electrolyte composition, stability, and current density optimization were key factors that contributed to the high power density and Zn utilization ratios in the Zn-NO2 battery system described in the study.",
