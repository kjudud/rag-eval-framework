    "content": "# Nitrogen-bridged Fe-Cu Atomic Pair Sites for Efficient Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Electricity Generation with  $\\mathbf{Zn - NO}_2$  Batteries\n\nZhenghui  $B_i^+$ , Jiao  $H_u^+$ , Ming  $X_u^+$ , Hua Zhang, Yingtang Zhou,* and Guangzhi  $H_u^*$\n\nAbstract The development of environmentally sustainable and highly efficient technologies for ammonia production is crucial for the future advancement of carbon- neutral energy systems. The nitrite reduction reaction  $(\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR})$  for generating  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  is a promising alternative to the low- efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), owing to the low  $\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{O}$  bond energy and high solubility of nitrite. In this study, we designed a highly efficient dual- atom catalyst with Fe- Cu atomic pair sites (termed FeCu DAC), and the as- developed FeCu DAC was able to afford a remarkable  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  yield of  $24,526\\mu \\mathrm{g}\\mathrm{h}^{- 1}$ $\\mathrm{mg_{cat.}^{- 1}}$  at  $- 0.6\\mathrm{V}$  with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  production of  $99.88\\%$ . The FeCu DAC also exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in a  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery, achieving a record- breaking power density of  $23.6\\mathrm{mWcm}^{- 1}$  and maximum  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  FE of  $92.23\\%$  at  $20\\mathrm{mAcm}^{- 2}$ . Theoretical simulation demonstrated that the incorporation of the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  atom changed the energy of the Fe 3d orbital and lowered the energy barrier, thereby accelerating the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ . This study not only demonstrates the potential of galvanic nitrite- based cells for expanding the field of  $\\mathrm{Zn}$ - based batteries, but also provides fundamental interpretation for the synergistic effect in highly dispersed dual- atom catalysts.\n\n# Introduction",

    "content": "# Introduction\n\nAmmonia is a widely- used industrial product that serves as the primary raw material for manufacturing nitrogen- based fertilizers. It is considered an ideal carbon- free fuel for low- carbon energy technologies.[1] The Haber- Bosch process, conventionally used for synthesizing  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ , involves high pressure and temperature, leading to excessive energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.[2] In recent years, there has been extensive interest in using water as a hydrogen source for the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen to  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ , which allows the direct generation of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  from  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$  under mild environmental conditions.[3] The outlook for the NRR appears grim due to the high energy required to cleave the non- polar  $\\mathrm{N} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$  bond  $(941\\mathrm{kJ}\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1})$  and low solubility of  $\\mathrm{N}_2$  in most electrolytes, which promotes the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and results in poor  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  selectivity and subpar current efficiency.[4] These problems severely limit the activity and selectivity of the NRR in aqueous media, which is a major constraint.  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  electrosynthesis can prospectively be realized via the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ , because of the substantially lower cleavage energy of the  $\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{O}$  bond  $(204\\mathrm{kJ}\\mathrm{mol}^{- 1})$  compared to that of the  $\\mathrm{N} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$  bond. In contrast with non- polar  $\\mathrm{N}_2$ ,  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  has excellent solubility in water, making it an appealing nitrogen supply that can potentially accelerate the kinetics of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3 / \\mathrm{NH}_4^+$  formation.[5] Additionally,  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  undergoes greater electrocatalytic reduction in the same thermodynamic potential range as  $\\mathrm{N}_2$ .[6]\n\nSingle- atom catalysts (SACs) have unique atomic structures and electronic properties that make them superior to bulk catalysts and nano catalysts. Researchers in the field of catalysis have shown great interest in SACs because of their remarkable activity and selectivity in many catalytic reactions.[7] The development of numerous  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  electrocatalysts is now a priority. Homogeneous and heterogeneous SACs offer new prospects for electrocatalysis and represent a potential  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  catalyst category. A significant number of pyrolytic SACs with an M- N- C (metal- nitrogen- carbon) structure have been studied for accelerating the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ .[8] Fe- N- C SACs have been extensively studied because of their low cost and excellent selectivity over a wide range of potential windows.[9] Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of Fe- N- C SACs can be fine- tuned by altering the coordination number or introducing vacancies to tune the electronic configuration of the Fe atom center.[10] Despite significant advances, the fundamentally stagnant kinetics of",

    "content": "# Introduction\n\nthe initial proton- coupled electron transfer at the Fe site strongly restricts the practical applicability of Fe- N- C SACs.[11] The construction of atom- pair structures has recently been considered an efficient method for modifying the activity of the catalytic sites, owing to cooperative electron modulation and the capability to overcome the limitations on the catalytic performance. However, because of a lack of intricate control mechanisms and thorough understanding of the structure of atom- pairs, the concept remains in its infancy and requires urgent advancement.\n\nIn this study, we strategically incorporate single Cu atoms into the microscopic structure of FeNC and finely adjust the 3d electronic configuration of the Fe site to augment its activity. However, Cu is considered an inert metal, and its presence can inhibit the competitive HER. In this regard, a nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu atom pair was designed for achieving high- efficiency  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  where the more electronegative Cu species is expected to raise the d- orbital energy level of the Fe active site, thereby strongly promoting the rate of the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ . In terms of the catalytic activity and selectivity, the as- developed two- atom center- site catalyst outperforms the single- atom congeners and previously investigated SACs. The innovative material, is utilized in a simple  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery device for the selective electroreduction of nitrogen oxyanions and synthesis of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ .\n\n# Results and Discussion\n\nBy using a straightforward liquid- phase deposition technique, completely exposed nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu pairs were effectively created with theoretical loadings of Fe:  $1.69\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  and Cu:  $1.89\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  (Table S1). The morphology and structure of FeCu DAC was initially investigated using aberration- corrected high- angle annular dark- field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF- STEM). As highlighted by the orange ovals, the densely distributed bright dots represent the Fe- Cu atom pairs. As depicted in Figure 1a, ultrasmall Fe- Cu pairs were completely exposed and evenly dispersed on the carbon substrate, devoid of any crystallized iron or copper nanoparticles. The dispersion of several spot pairs with two distinct contrasts on the carbon matrix can be observed in the atomic- resolution HAADF- STEM images, which points to the presence of numerous Fe- Cu diatomic pairs in the matrix. The magnified HAADF- STEM images (Figure 1b) show several colored spots with distinctive contrast and brightness owing to the differing Z- axis contrasts of Fe and Cu, which were clustered together to generate atomic groups, each of which included an Fe atom and a neighboring Cu atom. Moreover, the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of FeCu DAC (Figure 1f) show the simultaneous presence of iron and copper species within cluster regions on the surface, indicating that the Fe- Cu pairs are mainly composed of completely exposed and widely dispersed Fe and Cu atoms.",

    "content": "# Results and Discussion\n\nThe electronic structure and local configuration of FeCu DAC were investigated using X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron X- ray absorption fine- structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The high- resolution N is XPS profile of FeCu DAC definitively proved the existence of oxidized N  $(402.6\\mathrm{eV})$ , graphitic N  $(400.9\\mathrm{eV})$ , and pyridinic N  $(398.3\\mathrm{eV})$  (Figure S12). Notably, the spectrum of the metal- containing samples indicated the presence of other N species with a peak at  $399.9\\mathrm{eV}$ , attributed to pyrrolic metal- N coordination.[13] Additional information the electronic interactions was acquired using X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Figure 2a shows the XANES spectrum at the Fe K- edge for FeCu DAC, FePc (iron phthalocyanine, with Fe- N groups), and FeO, as well as that of  $\\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and Fe foil. The absorption edge position of FeCu DAC was between those of FePc and FeO, indicating that the average valence state of Fe was approximately  $+2$ . The local configuration around Fe was investigated using the Fourier transform (FT) of the extended X- ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum at the Fe K- edge (Figure 2c). The spectrum of FeCu DAC exhibits a maximum peak at  $1.53\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , matching the Fe- N first- shell coordination. There is no signal of the metallic Fe- Fe bond at  $2.12\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for FeCu DAC, again confirming the high dispersion of the metal atom. Excitingly, a distinct scattering path was observed at  $3.65\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the spectrum of FeCu DAC, which is neither from Fe- N  $(1.53\\mathrm{\\AA})$  nor from metallic Fe- Fe  $(2.12\\mathrm{\\AA})$ . From EXAFS curve- fitting analysis, it is deduced that such a path could be reasonably attributed to the contribution of Fe- N- Cu (Figure 2e). The Cu K- edge XANES spectrum was examined to provide additional structural details. Cu is in an average valence state that is positively charged (Figure 2b), where the edge position was close to that of the  $2+$  valence state of CuPc (copper phthalocyanine, with Cu- N groups). The Cu K- edge FT- EXAFS spectrum of FeCu DAC (Figure 2d), showed a main peak at  $1.56\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , which is obviously different from the dominant peak at  $2.24\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for Cu foil originating from the Cu- Cu bond. Furthermore, a tiny peak was also observed at  $3.47\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the spectrum of FeCu DAC at the Cu K- edge, similar to that observed at the Fe K- edge, the presence of which offers compelling proof of the Fe- N- Cu bond. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis, which enables high- resolution visualisation of the R- space, was executed to further confirm the existence of the Fe- N- Cu path (Figure 2g). The WT contour plot of Fe foil, shows an intensity maximum at  $7.17\\mathrm{\\AA}^{- 1}$  attributed to the Fe- Fe contribution, whereas no maximum was observed in the spectrum of FeCu DAC, demonstrating the absence of crystalline metal clusters in",

The maximum WT intensity caused by coordination of the light atom appeared at around  $6.56\\mathrm{\\AA}^{- 1}$  for FeCu DAC, matching the Fe- N scattering path. Identically, the intensity maximum observed in the WT contour plot of FeCu DAC at the Cu K- edge, which cannot be attributed to  $\\mathrm{Cu - Cu}$  or  $\\mathrm{Cu - N}$  paths, is thought to arise from the  $\\mathrm{Cu - N - Fe}$  contribution.

First, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) data were acquired in KOH electrolyte with and without  $\\mathrm{NaNO}_2$  to investigate the catalytic performance of FeCu DAC for nitrite reduction (Figure 3a).

Moreover, the ammonia- generating performance of the  $\\mathrm{FeCuN}_7$  active site is outstanding compared to that of other  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  systems that typically employ bulk or nanocluster metal catalysts. To investigate the active sites on FeCu DAC, a control experiment was performed with Fe and Cu atoms supported on a carbon substrate for comparison with FeCu DAC (Figure S19). The Fe and Cu SACs exhibited much lower  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  activity than FeCu DAC. Additionally, commercial FePc and CuPc displayed inferior catalytic performance compared to that of Fe SAC and Cu SAC, respectively.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the origin of the exceptional catalytic activity on the  $\\mathrm{FeCuN_7}$  site, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to delve into the fundamental mechanism of the  $\\mathrm{NO_2RR}$ , where the Fe site is considered rather than the Cu because of the higher intrinsic activity of the former.

It was also found that energy changes from  $\\mathrm{^*NO}_2$  to  $\\mathrm{^*N}$  were an exothermic process, which means that  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  can be adsorbed on the  $\\mathrm{FeCuN}_7$  surface spontaneously. Then, the  $\\mathrm{^*NO}_2$  was cleaved step by step to form  $\\mathrm{^*N}$ , which was then transformed into  $\\mathrm{^*NH}_4$  through a series of endothermic and exothermic processes. Furthermore, as shown in Figure S27, under alkaline conditions,  $\\mathrm{FeN}_4$  need to overcome higher number of energy barriers compared to  $\\mathrm{FeCuN}_7$  during water dissociation, thereby impeding hydrogen production.

In short, the incorporation of the  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  atom modified the electronic property of the Fe atom and thus reduced the thermodynamic energy barriers of key steps for  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ . This particular Fe- Cu configuration stimulates the electron redistribution of Fe to promote catalytic conversion of the intermediates, ultimately accelerating the electrocatalytic  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ .

    "content": "# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we rationally developed a novel FeCu DAC material exhibiting exceptional electrocatalytic properties for the direct nitrite electroreduction process in ammonia production. The DFT simulation reveals that the introduction of  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  leads to a reconstruction of the electronic structure of Fe in the FeCu DAC, effectively shifting the d- band center towards the Fermi level. This modification significantly enhances the capacity of Fe for adsorption of the intermediates and reduces reaction barriers, resulting in an unprecedented  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  yield of  $24,526 \\mu \\mathrm{g} \\mathrm{h}^{- 1} \\mathrm{mg}_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{- 1}$  at  $- 0.6 \\mathrm{~V}$  and a remarkable  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  FE of  $99.88\\%$ . Owing to the electron- rich  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  and excellent catalytic performance of FeCu DAC, a  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery system was established with the FeCu DAC cathode and a metal  $\\mathrm{Zn}$  anode. The constructed  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery can simultaneously produce ammonia and generate electricity, with a power density of  $23.6 \\mathrm{mW} \\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$  and a high  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  FE of  $92.23\\%$  at  $20 \\mathrm{mA} \\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$ . This study not only proposes a novel theory for purposefully tuning the catalytic performance of atom- dispersed metal catalysts, but also deepens the fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects in heterogeneous dual- atom catalysts. Furthermore, we have experimentally validated the effectiveness of galvanic nitrite- based battery, thereby\n\nproviding a viable method for  $\\mathrm{NH_3}$  production and advancing the field of Zn- based batteries.\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nAcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (U2002213) and Double- First Class University Plan (C176220100042).\n\n# Conflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\n# Data Availability Statement\n\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\nKeywords: Ammonia Production  $\\cdot$  Dual- Atom Catalyst  $\\cdot$  Nitrite Reduction Reaction  $\\cdot$  Zn- Based Battery",

    "content": "# Coordination Symmetry Breaking of Single-Atom Catalysts for Robust and Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia\n\nXue- Feng Cheng, Jing- Hui He,* Hao- Qing Ji, Hao- Yu Zhang, Qiang Cao, Wu- Ji Sun, Cheng- Lin Yan, and Jian- Mei Lu*\n\nNitrate electrocatalytic reduction  $(NO_3RR)$  for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N- cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber- Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long- term stability of  $NO_3RR$  catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry- broken Cusingle- atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than  $2000h$  while an average ammonia production rate of  $27.84\\mathrm{mg h^{- 1} cm^{- 2}}$  at an industrial level current density of  $366\\mathrm{mA cm^{- 2}}$  is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long- term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis- configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more  $NO_3^-$  near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis- coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital- symmetry- matched  $\\pi$  - complex of the key intermediate \\*ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the  $\\sigma$  - complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single- atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordinationsymmetry- broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nAccumulation of nitrate  $(NO_3^- )$  in groundwater causes photochemical smog and acid rain, and the in vivo conversion of  $NO_3^-$  to nitrite  $(NO_2^- )$  further induces methemoglobinemia and cancers.[1] Thus, closing the  $NO_3^- = N$  cycle by electrochemically reducing nitrate to a valued product ammonia, is promising for reducing carbon dioxide  $(CO_2)$  release and for environmental remediation.[2] In addition, ammonia  $(NH_3)$  as one of the most common chemical feedstocks[3] is mainly produced by the Haber- Bosch method, involving the reaction of  $N_2$  and  $H_2$  at high temperatures, accompanied by  $1 - 2\\%$  energy consumption and  $CO_2$  release.[4] Therefore, the nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction  $(NO_3RR)$  to ammonia, has recently attracted intensive interest because of the high water solubility of  $NO_3^-$  and the low dissociation energy of the  $N = O$  bond  $(204\\mathrm{kJ mol^{- 1}})$  of  $NO_3^-$ .[3a] Numerous noble metal nanoparticles,[2a,3] metal oxides,[10] and 2D materials[7] have been prepared and demonstrated their promising  $NO_3RR$  performance. Even though relatively high catalytic activity was obtained,[2a,8] only a few works focused on improving the catalytic stability.[9] Long- term stability of cata lyst is a more important factor towards real applications,[10] as deactivation of initially activated electrocatalysts after long- term operation due to passivation, leaching, and corrosion often occurs in industrialization.[9,11]",

    "content": "# 1. Introduction\n\nSingle- atom catalysts, owing to their maximum atom efficiency, tunable metal centers, and coordination environments,[12] have attracted growing interest in electrocatalysis, including electrochemical  $CO_2$  reduction,[13] hydrogen evolution,[14] and oxygen reduction.[15] The fully exposed active sites and strong interactions between single atoms and the surrounding coordination atoms endow single- atom catalysts with superior activity and appreciable stability.[15b,16] However, the isolated metal centers of most single- atom electrocatalysts coordinate with four N atoms in  $C_{4v}$  symmetry.[15a,17] These weakly polar active sites exhibit relatively weak attraction to  $NO_3^-$  ions, leading to weak ion migration, and consequently low ammonia production rates.[9,18] Thermodynamically,  $NO_3RR$  involves multiple steps, with the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons.[2b,19] Once adsorption on the catalyst surface is weak, the intermediate  $*NO_2$  may be desorbed from the catalyst surface and move to the electrolyte, resulting in the accumulation of more toxic nitrite.[3a,7,20] Therefore, substituting part of the coordinated N with weakly coordinated O/S atoms will break\n\nthe coordination symmetry of the metal centers and increase the site polarity,[21] which is expected to be an effective approach for improving  $\\mathrm{NO}_3^-$  accumulation. In particular, breaking the coordination symmetry by substituting two N atoms with heteroatoms causes the remaining two N to adopt cis- or transconfigurations, leaving room for further modulation of the electronic properties of the metal center.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate that by breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu single- atom catalysts (SACs) by substituting the local coordination atoms from 4N to  $2N + 20$  the stability of the  $\\mathrm{NO}_3\\mathrm{RR}$  electrocatalysts can be greatly improved. A model electrocatalyst with Cu coordinated by two N and two O atoms in the cis- configuration  $(\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2)$  is prepared by annealing Salen- Cu coordination polymers. The symmetry- broken  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  SAC strikes a good balance between catalytic activity and long- term stability. The ammonia production rate reaches  $2784\\mathrm{mg}\\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{- 1}\\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$  with an industrial- level current density of  $366\\mathrm{mAcm}^{- 2}$  and the catalytic activity is well preserved after operation for more than  $2000\\mathrm{h}$  (Table S1, Supporting Information). Compared to 4N- coordinated Cu SAC  $(\\mathrm{Cu - N_4})$  and Cu- trans-  $\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  (Cu coordinated by two N and two O atoms in the trans- configuration),  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  lowers down the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar. Thus, more  $\\mathrm{NO}_3^-$  can be accumulated near the electrocatalyst surface. In addition, the cis coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, allowing the formation of an orbital symmetry- matched  $\\pi$  complex of the key reaction intermediate  $\\mathrm{^*ONH}$  rather than the conventional  $\\sigma$  complex, where the former reduces the formation energy barrier, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. This unprecedentedly long- term stability with continuously ammonia production step forward the practical applications.\n\n# 2. Results and Discussions",

Thereafter,  $\\mathrm{^*NO}_3$  reacts with protons and electrons, breaking the  $\\mathrm{N} - \\mathrm{O}$  bond step by step to form  $\\mathrm{^*NO}_2$  and  $\\mathrm{^*NO}$  The further reduction of  $\\mathrm{^*NO}$  can proceed via two possible pathways.[22] The proton- electron pair could attack  $\\mathrm{^*NO}$  through either the O or N side, proceeding through the NOH and ONH pathways, respectively. From  $\\mathrm{^*NO}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{^*NOH}$  the calculated formation barrier is  $1.23\\mathrm{eV}$  which is larger than the energy barrier for the  $\\mathrm{^*NO}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{^*ONH}$  process  $(0.39\\mathrm{eV})$  . Therefore, the ONH pathway is more favorable. Subsequently,  $\\mathrm{^*ONH}$  species are continuously reduced to  $\\mathrm{^*ONH_2}$  and  $\\mathrm{^*ONH_2}$  with negative  $\\Delta G$  values.

The catalyst slurry was pasted onto a porous polytetrafluoroethylene membrane, the back side of which was exposed to the mass spectrometer (MS), allowing the penetration of various gaseous products into the MS for further detection.

Such strong adsorptive interactions with nitrate are consistent with molecular dynamics simulation, proving the first important coordination symmetry breaking effect when  $2\\mathrm{N} + 2\\mathrm{O}$  atoms replace 4N atoms. In addition,  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  possesses a much higher barrier  $(2.60\\mathrm{eV})$  than  $\\mathrm{Cu - trans - N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$ $(- 2.20\\mathrm{eV})$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_4}$ $(1.36\\mathrm{eV})$  , hindering the release of toxic  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  ions during the reaction.

These symmetry breakings are attributable to the much weaker coordination ability of O compared to N in nature and the saturated form O atoms  $(- O - )$  in the graphene matrix. We also calculated the energy barrier of  $\\mathrm{^*NO\\rightarrow^*ONH}$  in ONH path  $(\\Delta G_{\\ast \\mathrm{NO}\\rightarrow \\ast \\mathrm{ONH}})$  in  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_3O_1}$ $\\mathrm{Cu - N_1O_3},$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu - O_4}$  SACs (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). With the increase of coordinating O atoms,  $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{RDS}}$  gradually decreases, indicating the increase in catalytic activity.

The partial density of states of the Cu 3d orbitals in  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_4}$  and two types of  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_2O_2}$  SAC systems was calculated (Figure 2d- f), and an H- terminated finite cluster model was used to visualize these orbitals (Figure S8, Supporting Information). In  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_4}$ $\\mathrm{d}_{x^2 - y^2}$  is raised to the highest occupied d- orbital owing to the strong coordination of the N atoms. In both Cu- trans-  $\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  and Cu- cis $\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2,$  all Cu 3d orbitals fell below the Fermi level and were fully occupied. In  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$ $\\mathrm{d}_{x^2 - y^2}$  is essentially the highest occupied d- orbital, despite slight coupling with other 3d orbitals, whereas in Cu- trans-  $\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2,$  the highest d orbital is  $\\mathrm{d}_{z^2}$  - like",

Results and Discussions\n\nInspired by the theoretical analysis,  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  single- atom catalysts were prepared by the pyrolysis of 1D organic- inorganic chains, where the Salen ligand was used as a matrix for dispersing and coordinating  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  ions in an exact  $cis - \\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  configuration (Figure 3a). During pyrolysis, the good planarity and  $\\mathrm{sp}^2$  hybridization of carbon were beneficial for preserving the  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  configuration. Interconversion between the cis and trans configurations during pyrolysis is intuitively difficult because of the need to break multiple  $\\mathrm{C - O}$  and  $\\mathrm{C - N}$  bonds simultaneously. The porous structure of the 1D organic- inorganic chains was well preserved after pyrolysis under the protection of Ar (Figures S5 and S10, Supporting Information). When the Cu- to- Salen molar ratio of the reactants decreased, the content of copper nanoparticles in the carbonized catalyst gradually decreased (Figure 3b). Once the Cu- to- Salen molar ratio in the reactants decreased to  $3\\%$ , no copper nanoparticles were formed (Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information), and this ratio was chosen for subsequent experiments. The aberration- corrected high- angle annular dark- field scanning transmission electron microscopy image confirms the existence of isolated  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  single atoms dispersed on the porous carbon matrix (Figure 3d). Energy- dispersive X- ray spectroscopy mapping analysis confirmed the existence and uniform distribution of  $\\mathrm{Cu}$ ,  $\\mathrm{N}$ ,  $\\mathrm{O}$ , and  $\\mathrm{C}$  throughout the catalyst (Figure 3f). The final  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  loading in SAC was about  $5.04 \\mathrm{wt\\%}$  based on inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP- AES) analysis.

The signals of Cu, C, N, and O were detected in the profiles of both the Salen- Cu precursors and  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  SAC. The deconvoluted high- resolution N 1 s spectra confirm preservation of the  $\\mathrm{Cu - N}$  bond  $(399.2\\mathrm{eV})$  and the generation of pyridinic N and graphitic N after pyrolysis (Figure 4a).[23] The signal of the  $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{O}$  double bond was deconvoluted from the high- resolution O 1 s spectrum (Figure 4b), as well as the C 1 s spectrum (Figure 4c) after pyrolysis. During the initial preparation of Salen- Cu, the Salen ligand centers in the 1D chains did not fully coordinate with the copper ions. These empty Salen ligand centers may produce a  $- \\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{O}$  moiety during pyrolysis.\n\nSynchrotron- based X- ray absorption near- edge structure (XANES) and extended X- ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were obtained to further validate the coordination configuration of  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  SAC. The Cu K- edge XANES spectra show that the energy absorption threshold of  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  SAC is located between those of  $\\mathrm{Cu_2O}$  and  $\\mathrm{CuO}$ , suggesting that the valence state of  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  SAC is situated between those of  $\\mathrm{Cu^{+}}$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu^{2 + }}$  (Figure 4d). The fitted oxidation state of  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  in  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  from the K- edge XANES spectra is 1.84 (Figure S16, Supporting Information), which agrees well with previous results.[24] The high- resolution Cu 3d (Figure S17, Supporting Information) XPS profile also shows that the valence of  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  in  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  SAC was lower than +2. The Fourier transform (FT)  $\\mathrm{k}^3$ - weighted  $\\chi (k)$  - function of the Cu K- edge EXAFS data in R space shows a single scattering path at  $\\approx 1.47\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  SAC, which is similar to that for Salen- Cu, assigned to the  $\\mathrm{Cu - N / O}$  path. The absence of the  $\\mathrm{Cu - Cu}$  scattering path  $(2.24\\mathrm{\\AA})$  reveals the presence of atomic  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  sites in the sample (Figure 4e). However, further distinguishing the coordination paths of  $\\mathrm{N}$  and  $\\mathrm{O}$  would be challenging because of the similar bond lengths of  $\\mathrm{Cu - N}$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu - O}$ .[25]",

The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was measured through double- layer capacitance method and the current densities were plot as a function of scan rate (Figure S18, Supporting Information). ECSA of  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  was estimated as approximately  $60~\\mathrm{cm^2}$  . Upon varying the voltage from  $- 1.0$  to  $- 2.0\\mathrm{V}$  (versus RHE hereafter), the ammonia production rate gradually increased, but the selectivity and Faradic efficiency for ammonia production first increased and then decreased (Figure 5b). Thus,  $- 1.6\\mathrm{V}$  was selected as the optimal operation voltage. With prolonged reaction time, the concentration of nitrate continuously dropped with  $93.19\\%$  conversion at  $^{\\textrm{\\scriptsize 8h}}$  and that of ammonia gradually increased, obeying first- order kinetics (Figure 5c). This suggests that even at a high nitrate concentration, the reaction rate is sufficiently fast and is only limited by the diffusion of nitrate from the bulk to the electrode surface. Therefore, symmetry- breaking- induced surface accumulation plays a non- trivial role. The concentration of  $\\mathrm{NO}_2^-$  first increased and then decreased, maintaining a low production rate. Below  $- 2.0\\mathrm{V}$  when the background ammonia production was subtracted from that of the blank  $\\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}$  solution, the ammonia production rate reached  $28.73\\pm 1.25\\mathrm{mg h^{- 1} cm^{- 2}}$  (Figure 5d), and the selectivity and Faradic efficiency for ammonia",
