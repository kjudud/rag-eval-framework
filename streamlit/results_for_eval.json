These symmetry breakings are attributable to the much weaker coordination ability of O compared to N in nature and the saturated form O atoms  $(- O - )$  in the graphene matrix. We also calculated the energy barrier of  $\\mathrm{^*NO\\rightarrow^*ONH}$  in ONH path  $(\\Delta G_{\\ast \\mathrm{NO}\\rightarrow \\ast \\mathrm{ONH}})$  in  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_3O_1}$ $\\mathrm{Cu - N_1O_3},$  and  $\\mathrm{Cu - O_4}$  SACs (Figure S6a, Supporting Information). With the increase of coordinating O atoms,  $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{RDS}}$  gradually decreases, indicating the increase in catalytic activity. While the stability of Cu SACs gradually decreases because of weaker coordination ability of O atoms. Taking both catalytic activity and long- term stability into consideration, partially substituted  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_2O_2}$  SACs may be able to balance these two factors well. Furthermore, the coordination symmetry breaking also has comparable contribution to the decrease of  $\\Delta G_{\\ast \\mathrm{NO}\\rightarrow \\ast \\mathrm{ONH}}$  .Cu- trans-  $\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2,$  with higher coordination symmetry has similar  $\\Delta G_{\\ast \\mathrm{NO}\\rightarrow \\ast \\mathrm{ONH}}$  to that of  $\\mathrm{Cu - N_3O_1}$  .

However, current long- term stability of  $NO_3RR$  catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry- broken Cusingle- atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than  $2000h$  while an average ammonia production rate of  $27.84\\mathrm{mg h^{- 1} cm^{- 2}}$  at an industrial level current density of  $366\\mathrm{mA cm^{- 2}}$  is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long- term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis- configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more  $NO_3^-$  near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis- coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital- symmetry- matched  $\\pi$  - complex of the key intermediate \\*ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the  $\\sigma$  - complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single- atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordinationsymmetry- broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.\n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nAccumulation of nitrate  $(NO_3^- )$  in groundwater causes photochemical smog and acid rain, and the in vivo conversion of  $NO_3^-$  to nitrite  $(NO_2^- )$  further induces methemoglobinemia and cancers.[1] Thus, closing the  $NO_3^- = N$  cycle by electrochemically reducing nitrate to a valued product ammonia, is promising for reducing carbon dioxide  $(CO_2)$  release and for environmental remediation.[2] In addition, ammonia  $(NH_3)$  as one of the most common chemical feedstocks[3] is mainly produced by the Haber- Bosch method, involving the reaction of  $N_2$  and  $H_2$  at high temperatures, accompanied by  $1 - 2\\%$  energy consumption and  $CO_2$  release.[4] Therefore, the nitrate electrochemical reduction reaction  $(NO_3RR)$  to ammonia, has recently attracted intensive interest because of the high water solubility of  $NO_3^-$  and the low dissociation energy of the  $N = O$  bond  $(204\\mathrm{kJ mol^{- 1}})$  of  $NO_3^-$ .[3a] Numerous noble metal nanoparticles,[2a,3] metal oxides,[10] and 2D materials[7] have been prepared and demonstrated their promising  $NO_3RR$  performance. Even though relatively high catalytic activity was obtained,[2a,8] only a few works focused on improving the catalytic stability.[9] Long- term stability of cata lyst is a more important factor towards real applications,[10] as deactivation of initially activated electrocatalysts after long- term operation due to passivation, leaching, and corrosion often occurs in industrialization.[9,11]"

The nitrite reduction reaction  $(\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR})$  for generating  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  is a promising alternative to the low- efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), owing to the low  $\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{O}$  bond energy and high solubility of nitrite.

The FeCu DAC also exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in a  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery, achieving a record- breaking power density of  $23.6\\mathrm{mWcm}^{- 1}$  and maximum  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  FE of  $92.23\\%$  at  $20\\mathrm{mAcm}^{- 2}$ .

However, because of a lack of intricate control mechanisms and thorough understanding of the structure of atom- pairs, the concept remains in its infancy and requires urgent advancement.\n\nIn this study, we strategically incorporate single Cu atoms into the microscopic structure of FeNC and finely adjust the 3d electronic configuration of the Fe site to augment its activity. However, Cu is considered an inert metal, and its presence can inhibit the competitive HER. In this regard, a nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu atom pair was designed for achieving high- efficiency  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  where the more electronegative Cu species is expected to raise the d- orbital energy level of the Fe active site, thereby strongly promoting the rate of the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ . In terms of the catalytic activity and selectivity, the as- developed two- atom center- site catalyst outperforms the single- atom congeners and previously investigated SACs. The innovative material, is utilized in a simple  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery device for the selective electroreduction of nitrogen oxyanions and synthesis of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ .\n\n# Results and Discussion\n\nBy using a straightforward liquid- phase deposition technique, completely exposed nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu pairs were effectively created with theoretical loadings of Fe:  $1.69\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  and Cu:  $1.89\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  (Table S1). The morphology and structure of FeCu DAC was initially investigated using aberration- corrected high- angle annular dark- field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF- STEM). As highlighted by the orange ovals, the densely distributed bright dots represent the Fe- Cu atom pairs. As depicted in Figure 1a, ultrasmall Fe- Cu pairs were completely exposed and evenly dispersed on the carbon substrate, devoid of any crystallized iron or copper nanoparticles. The dispersion of several spot pairs with two distinct contrasts on the carbon matrix can be observed in the atomic- resolution HAADF- STEM images, which points to the presence of numerous Fe- Cu diatomic pairs in the matrix. The magnified HAADF- STEM images (Figure 1b) show several colored spots with distinctive contrast and brightness owing to the differing Z- axis contrasts of Fe and Cu, which were clustered together to generate atomic groups, each of which included an Fe atom and a neighboring Cu atom. Moreover, the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of FeCu DAC (Figure 1f) show the simultaneous presence of iron and copper species within cluster regions on the surface, indicating that the Fe- Cu pairs are mainly composed of completely exposed and widely dispersed Fe and Cu atoms."

Results and Discussions\n\nInspired by the theoretical analysis,  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  single- atom catalysts were prepared by the pyrolysis of 1D organic- inorganic chains, where the Salen ligand was used as a matrix for dispersing and coordinating  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  ions in an exact  $cis - \\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{O}_2$  configuration (Figure 3a). During pyrolysis, the good planarity and  $\\mathrm{sp}^2$  hybridization of carbon were beneficial for preserving the  $\\mathrm{Cu - cis - N_2O_2}$  configuration. Interconversion between the cis and trans configurations during pyrolysis is intuitively difficult because of the need to break multiple  $\\mathrm{C - O}$  and  $\\mathrm{C - N}$  bonds simultaneously. The porous structure of the 1D organic- inorganic chains was well preserved after pyrolysis under the protection of Ar (Figures S5 and S10, Supporting Information). When the Cu- to- Salen molar ratio of the reactants decreased, the content of copper nanoparticles in the carbonized catalyst gradually decreased (Figure 3b). Once the Cu- to- Salen molar ratio in the reactants decreased to  $3\\%$ , no copper nanoparticles were formed (Figures S11 and S12, Supporting Information), and this ratio was chosen for subsequent experiments. The aberration- corrected high- angle annular dark- field scanning transmission electron microscopy image confirms the existence of isolated  $\\mathrm{Cu}$  single atoms dispersed on the porous carbon matrix (Figure 3d).

The constructed  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery can simultaneously produce ammonia and generate electricity, with a power density of  $23.6 \\mathrm{mW} \\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$  and a high  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$  FE of  $92.23\\%$  at  $20 \\mathrm{mA} \\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$ . This study not only proposes a novel theory for purposefully tuning the catalytic performance of atom- dispersed metal catalysts, but also deepens the fundamental understanding of the synergistic effects in heterogeneous dual- atom catalysts.

          "text": "# Introduction\n\nthe initial proton- coupled electron transfer at the Fe site strongly restricts the practical applicability of Fe- N- C SACs.[11] The construction of atom- pair structures has recently been considered an efficient method for modifying the activity of the catalytic sites, owing to cooperative electron modulation and the capability to overcome the limitations on the catalytic performance. However, because of a lack of intricate control mechanisms and thorough understanding of the structure of atom- pairs, the concept remains in its infancy and requires urgent advancement.\n\nIn this study, we strategically incorporate single Cu atoms into the microscopic structure of FeNC and finely adjust the 3d electronic configuration of the Fe site to augment its activity. However, Cu is considered an inert metal, and its presence can inhibit the competitive HER. In this regard, a nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu atom pair was designed for achieving high- efficiency  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$  where the more electronegative Cu species is expected to raise the d- orbital energy level of the Fe active site, thereby strongly promoting the rate of the  $\\mathrm{NO}_2\\mathrm{RR}$ . In terms of the catalytic activity and selectivity, the as- developed two- atom center- site catalyst outperforms the single- atom congeners and previously investigated SACs. The innovative material, is utilized in a simple  $\\mathrm{Zn - NO}_2$  battery device for the selective electroreduction of nitrogen oxyanions and synthesis of  $\\mathrm{NH}_3$ .\n\n# Results and Discussion\n\nBy using a straightforward liquid- phase deposition technique, completely exposed nitrogen- bridged Fe- Cu pairs were effectively created with theoretical loadings of Fe:  $1.69\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  and Cu:  $1.89\\mathrm{wt}\\%$  (Table S1). The morphology and structure of FeCu DAC was initially investigated using aberration- corrected high- angle annular dark- field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF- STEM). As highlighted by the orange ovals, the densely distributed bright dots represent the Fe- Cu atom pairs. As depicted in Figure 1a, ultrasmall Fe- Cu pairs were completely exposed and evenly dispersed on the carbon substrate, devoid of any crystallized iron or copper nanoparticles. The dispersion of several spot pairs with two distinct contrasts on the carbon matrix can be observed in the atomic- resolution HAADF- STEM images, which points to the presence of numerous Fe- Cu diatomic pairs in the matrix. The magnified HAADF- STEM images (Figure 1b) show several colored spots with distinctive contrast and brightness owing to the differing Z- axis contrasts of Fe and Cu, which were clustered together to generate atomic groups, each of which included an Fe atom and a neighboring Cu atom. Moreover, the corresponding energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of FeCu DAC (Figure 1f) show the simultaneous presence of iron and copper species within cluster regions on the surface, indicating that the Fe- Cu pairs are mainly composed of completely exposed and widely dispersed Fe and Cu atoms."

          "text": "# Results and Discussion\n\nThe electronic structure and local configuration of FeCu DAC were investigated using X- ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron X- ray absorption fine- structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The high- resolution N is XPS profile of FeCu DAC definitively proved the existence of oxidized N  $(402.6\\mathrm{eV})$ , graphitic N  $(400.9\\mathrm{eV})$ , and pyridinic N  $(398.3\\mathrm{eV})$  (Figure S12). Notably, the spectrum of the metal- containing samples indicated the presence of other N species with a peak at  $399.9\\mathrm{eV}$ , attributed to pyrrolic metal- N coordination.[13] Additional information the electronic interactions was acquired using X- ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Figure 2a shows the XANES spectrum at the Fe K- edge for FeCu DAC, FePc (iron phthalocyanine, with Fe- N groups), and FeO, as well as that of  $\\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{O}_3$  and Fe foil. The absorption edge position of FeCu DAC was between those of FePc and FeO, indicating that the average valence state of Fe was approximately  $+2$ . The local configuration around Fe was investigated using the Fourier transform (FT) of the extended X- ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum at the Fe K- edge (Figure 2c). The spectrum of FeCu DAC exhibits a maximum peak at  $1.53\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , matching the Fe- N first- shell coordination. There is no signal of the metallic Fe- Fe bond at  $2.12\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for FeCu DAC, again confirming the high dispersion of the metal atom. Excitingly, a distinct scattering path was observed at  $3.65\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the spectrum of FeCu DAC, which is neither from Fe- N  $(1.53\\mathrm{\\AA})$  nor from metallic Fe- Fe  $(2.12\\mathrm{\\AA})$ . From EXAFS curve- fitting analysis, it is deduced that such a path could be reasonably attributed to the contribution of Fe- N- Cu (Figure 2e). The Cu K- edge XANES spectrum was examined to provide additional structural details. Cu is in an average valence state that is positively charged (Figure 2b), where the edge position was close to that of the  $2+$  valence state of CuPc (copper phthalocyanine, with Cu- N groups). The Cu K- edge FT- EXAFS spectrum of FeCu DAC (Figure 2d), showed a main peak at  $1.56\\mathrm{\\AA}$ , which is obviously different from the dominant peak at  $2.24\\mathrm{\\AA}$  for Cu foil originating from the Cu- Cu bond. Furthermore, a tiny peak was also observed at  $3.47\\mathrm{\\AA}$  in the spectrum of FeCu DAC at the Cu K- edge, similar to that observed at the Fe K- edge, the presence of which offers compelling proof of the Fe- N- Cu bond. Wavelet transform (WT) analysis, which enables high- resolution visualisation of the R- space, was executed to further confirm the existence of the Fe- N- Cu path (Figure 2g). The WT contour plot of Fe foil, shows an intensity maximum at  $7.17\\mathrm{\\AA}^{- 1}$  attributed to the Fe- Fe contribution, whereas no maximum was observed in the spectrum of FeCu DAC, demonstrating the absence of crystalline metal clusters in"
